# 📱 Twilio WhatsApp Integration Setup

## ✅ Configuration Complete!

Your Twilio WhatsApp service has been configured with the following credentials:

```env
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token

## 📋 Important Notes

### WhatsApp Sandbox (For Testing)
If you're using Twilio's WhatsApp Sandbox for testing:
1. Users must first send a message to your Twilio WhatsApp number
2. The message should be: `join <your-sandbox-code>`
3. Only then can they receive WhatsApp messages

### Production WhatsApp
For production use:
1. You need to apply for WhatsApp Business API approval through Twilio
2. Get your WhatsApp number approved
3. Create and approve message templates
4. Update the configuration accordingly

### Phone Number Format
The system automatically formats phone numbers:
- Indian numbers: Adds +91 country code
- 10-digit numbers: Converted to +91XXXXXXXXXX
- Already formatted numbers: Used as-is

## 🔧 Testing WhatsApp

### Test Endpoint
```bash
POST http://localhost:3001/api/test-whatsapp

  "message": "Test message from Blue Tap Connect"
}
```

### Check Logs
The backend will log:
- WhatsApp message attempts

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Messages Not Sending?
1. **Check Twilio Account**: Ensure account is active and has credits
2. **Verify Phone Numbers**: Numbers must be in correct format
3. **Sandbox Join**: For testing, users must join sandbox first
4. **Check Logs**: Look at backend console for error messages

### Common Errors
- **Error 21211**: Invalid 'To' phone number
  - Solution: Ensure phone number includes country code
- **Error 21608**: Unable to send message to this number
  - Solution: Number must join sandbox first (for testing)
- **Error 20003**: Authentication failed
  - Solution: Check Account SID and Auth Token

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Restart Backend Server** to apply changes
2. **Test with your phone number** using the test endpoint
3. **Submit a test report** to see both email and WhatsApp
4. **Monitor logs** for any issues
